## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, here are your options:
- DM [thetechwiz5305](https://discord.com/users/796829200962814023) and/or [shad0w_dev](https://discord.com/users/699152711374864454) on Discord. Both of our DMs are always open, and Tech checks his message requests when he can.

Please ensure you include a detailed description and photos/videos that show how it works. It can take up to a few weeks (or longer, depending on the complexity) for the patch to be pushed, so be patient.
