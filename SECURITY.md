## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, here are your options:
- DM [thetechwiz5305](https://discord.com/users/796829200962814023) and/or [shad0w_dev](https://discord.com/users/699152711374864454) on Discord. Both of our DMs are always open, and Tech always checks his message requests when he can.
- Email [glitchedcatstudios@gmail.com](mailto:glitchedcatstudios@gmail.com). Expect a response within 1-3 days.

Make sure you attach a long description, and photos/videos of how it works. It can take up to a few weeks for the patch to be pushed, so be patient.
