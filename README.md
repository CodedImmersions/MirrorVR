# MirrorVR

MirrorVR is a put-together package of a VR version of [Mirror](https://github.com/MirrorNetworking/Mirror) that is not out yet but is in development.

But, there is a catch. Mirror is P2P networking, so when the host disconnects, the whole room disconnects, because everything relies on the host/server. We are working on a fix, by coding in host migration into the package.
