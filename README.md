# MirrorVR

MirrorVR is a put-together package of a VR version of [Mirror](https://github.com/MirrorNetworking/Mirror) that is not out yet but is in development.
I will ONLY release this if Photon is having a crisis because Mirror is a steep learning curve. This will also use an edited EpicOnlineTransport to get 100% free networking.
BUT there is a catch. Mirror is P2P networking, so when the host disconnects, the whole room disconnects, because everything relies on the host/server.
